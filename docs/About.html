            <p> Hi there! As you likely saw from the homepage, I'm TK (he/him). I'm a research associate at the University of Colorado at Boulder in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/amath/" style="color:cyan">Applied Mathematics department</a>. I am funded through <a href="https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/jdm/" style="color:cyan">Prof. James Meiss</a> Simons Collaboration Grant on <a href="https://hiddensymmetries.princeton.edu/" style="color:cyan">Hidden Symmetries and Fusion Energy</a>. 
            
I absolutely love mathematics and essentially anything STEM related can pique my curiosity but specifically I spend my time studying differential geometry, differential equations, and their applications. I'm also starting to dabble in the land of Machine Learning as well. To see specifics
		of what I do (or MIGHT be doing) head over to my <a href="ResearchNew.html" style="color:cyan">Research</a> page. </p><br />
	    <p> 	Aside from the mathematical and academic life I try to do a little bit of everything in my free time (although COVID-19 has made some of these more difficult...). I like to run, paint miniatures, draw,
		play guitar and drums, solve puzzles, play video games and board games, etc. and as a Coloradan turned temporary U.S. State of Hawai`i resident, I greatly enjoy hiking! </p><br />
	    <p> For a quick summary of what I've done and been up to academically, take a look at my <a href="KlotzCV.pdf" style="color:cyan">C.V.</a></p><br/>
	    
	    <p> Also, it is a fact that mathematics is a fundamentally human endeavor. Our collective understanding of mathematics as a species is what allows any mathematician alive today to prove theorems that may have been inaccessible to even the most talented minds of prior generations. It follows that disinclusion (deliberate or otherwise) from mathematics of our fellow humans based on race, sexual identity, religion, etc. means not only harm to individuals but also less mathematics for the community as a whole and future mathematicians.</p><br/>
