<h1> Interests and Background </h1>
	    <p> In general I have a very broad interest in plasma physics, geometric control theory, PDE, applied mathematics, geometric analysis, and 
	      contact geometry. However, my attention is currently focused on the use of Exterior Differential Systems (EDS),
		  Cartan's method of Equivalence, and moving frames to study problems in plasma physics with applications to Stellarator fusion devices. My other main research area is geometric control theory via Cartan type methods. I have also been working on a project related to bi-contact geometry and would like to expand my research further in this direction. My <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08521.pdf" syle="color:cyan"> full length thesis </a>) is in the area of geometric control theory, specifically relating to the theory of cascade feedback linearization of control
		  systems with symmetry, which in turn has important implications for the study of dynamic feedback linearizable control systems. My thesis draws on subjects such as EDS, Goursat bundles, Calculus of Variations, and Lie algebras. It's a very enjoyable overlap of subjects and I hope to continue finding more tools from other areas in geometry to answer questions in control theory. My advisor was the excellent <a href="http://math.colorado.edu/~jnc/" style="color:cyan">Professor Jeanne Clelland</a> with <a href="https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/vassiliou-pj" style="color:cyan">Peter Vassiliou</a> as my wonderful co-advisor.
<br>
<br>
My advisor and I authored <a href="https://rdcu.be/b2DZq" style="color:cyan">this paper </a> in the Archive for Rational Mechanics. It gives further explicit results on the ``rarity" of Beltrami fields with non-constant proportionality factor. These types of solutions are of interest to the areas of hydrodynamics and plasma physics.

Before my current work, my first two years of graduate school were spent studying fluid equations from the perspective of infinite-dimensional Riemannian geometry. For example, the Euler equations for incompressible fluid flow on a finite dimensional manifold are precisely the Euler-Arnold equations on the space of volume preserving diffeomorphisms (endowed with an appropriate metric, that is). I still find this area interesting! Perhaps if the Universe allows I will return to these topics someday in a more serious way.
